If you use that – you’re off the challenge.</p><p>If you’re stuck for ideas, one great way to flex your writing muscle is to engage in what’s called ‘freewriting’:</p> <ul><li><strong>Just start</strong> writing anything that comes into your head – don’t stop for 15 minutes.</li> <li><strong>Don’t wait</strong> for a beautiful 1st sentence to appear.</li><li><strong>Don’t edit</strong> your words and don’t look back.</li><li><strong>Don’t judge</strong> your work.</li></ul><p>When you’ve completed your step, <a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{% url 'app_steps_track' goal_id=goal.id step_id=goal.current_step.id %}">click here to track and tell us about your progress</a>.</p><p>Keep going! Remember that this challenge can transform your writing!</p><p>Bec and Chris</p>{% endblock %}
