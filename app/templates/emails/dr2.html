It doesn&rsquo;t stop there:</p><p><em>Liz said: &ldquo;Your course was just the thing to revitalise me. I thought you'd got a great recipe going. You've definitely prompted a fresh burst of writing.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Ed said: <em>I&rsquo;ve now managed to start the e-editing process and have formalised the order in which I will organise the book now. I&rsquo;m planning on continuing editing it over the next week. Thanks for all your help.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Sam said:<em> &ldquo;I made really good progress with my overall goal, to write something from scratch and feel like I can carry on writing well from here. Thank you for helping me through.&rdquo;</em></p><p>And finally, Maggie said:<em> &ldquo;Your course gave just the kick I needed. I now have a rough outline for the last three chapters so have a direction to follow and feel this is a huge step forward.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Just think, all these writers have made major steps towards finishing their projects and achieving their writing goals.</p><p>You can too. <strong><a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{% url 'app_goals_new' %}">Click here to get started.</a></strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s do this!
