<p>Great news! You’ve set a goal for this 5-day writing challenge and agreed your first step – amazing.</p>

<p>You’re on your way to transforming your writing practice over the next 5 days.</p> 

<p>You’ve made a promise that your goal this week is:</p>

<p><pre>{{ goal.current_step.text }}</pre></p>

<p>And your first step to achieving it is:</p>

<p><pre>{{ first_step.text }}</pre></p>

<p>You’ve got 24 hours to achieve your first step – that’s your deadline.</p> 

<p>More writers fail to progress at this stage than at any other step.</p>

<ul>
  <li>80% of all the writers who fail this challenge – stop at this point. Don’t stop here. If you want to finish this challenge – keep going.</li>
  <li>70% of writers who complete their first step go on to successfully finish. Go on, be a winner.</li> 
</ul>

<p>This is the hardest step. This is where you prove yourself as a writer. This is why you should complete this first step. Why not do it now?</p>
