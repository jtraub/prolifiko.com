<p>Hi</p>

<p>Hurrah! You’ve now completed day two of your 5-day writing challenge!</p>  

<p>Now, we’d really like to share with you another secret of writing productivity and that’s to… <strong>go public!</strong></p>  

<p>Science shows that you’re far more likely to reach your goal if you share it with other people – and that’s because other people are great at holding us to account. So, why not tell someone else about this 5-day writing challenge? Tell a friend, colleague or family member, share it on Facebook, tweet about it on Twitter! The key thing is that you tell someone.</p> 

<p>If you want to learn more, check out our free resource: <a href="http://blog.write-track.co.uk/goal-setting/social/">6 ways to become more accountable to others (and write more)</a>.</p>

<p>In our next email, you’ll learn why rewarding yourself is key to developing an effective writing practice.</p> 

<p>But now, back to the challenge.</p> 

<p>You set yourself a third step to:</p>

<p><pre>{{ next_step.text }}</pre></p>

<p>When you’ve completed this step, <a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{% url 'app_steps_track' goal_id=next_step.goal.id step_id=next_step.id %}">click here to track and tell us about your progress</a>.</p>

<p>Remember, if you don’t track within 24 hours – you’ll lose a life. If you’ve used both your lives you’ll be off the challenge.</p> 

<p>You’re nearly halfway there!</p> 

<p>Bec and Chris</p>
