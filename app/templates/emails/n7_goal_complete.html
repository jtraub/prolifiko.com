<p>That&rsquo;s it! Well done &ndash; we&rsquo;re so proud of your progress.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve now completed the last and final step of your 5-day writing challenge and you&rsquo;ve officially given your writing the kickstart it deserves.</p>
<p>A huge congratulations from us both! We&rsquo;re pleased as punch.</p>
<p>Finally, we&rsquo;d like to share with you our last secret of writing productivity and that is&hellip; <strong>that there is no secret!</strong></p>
<p>To be a writer &ndash; to hone your craft and get better &ndash; you need to write more regularly.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what this 5-day email challenge has been all about.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter what you write, how many words you write or how long you write for &ndash; the key is to write, and do it regularly to build a writing practice. Research has shown that people who write regularly are not only more productive, but they have more ideas and also feel happier. What&rsquo;s not to like?!</p>
<p>The more you write, the better you will become - the better you become the more you&rsquo;ll enjoy it, and the more likely you are to keep writing and complete your writing projects.</p>
