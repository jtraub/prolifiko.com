<p>Congratulations! You’ve completed day 1 of your 5-day writing challenge!</p>

<p>I’d like to share with you our 1st secret of writing productivity and that’s to… book in the time.</p>

<p>Science tells us that committing time to write is one of the best ways to avoid procrastination.
There are lots of different approaches to finding the time to write but essentially it all comes
down to scheduling. Take your diary, find time that you can use for writing and make an appointment
so you treat it like any other commitment. Start small – it could just be fifteen minutes a day – and
build up from there. It’s important to get into the habit of sticking to a schedule.</p>
